.Sh NAME
.Nm thingsd.conf
.Nd thingsd proxy daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the things proxy daemon,
.Xr thingsd 8 .
.Sh SECTIONS
.Nm
is divided into two main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr thingsd 8 .
Do note that global settings should never be placed after the things section
has been defined.
.It Sy things
things are the configuration areas for each thing a client can communicate
with.
.El
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore
must be quoted.
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
Here are the settings that can be set globally:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic default port Ar number
Set the default port for things to communicate on. This is a required setting.
.It Ic bind interface Ar string
Specify a single interface to create sockets on. If this is not set,
.Xr thingsd 8
will attempt to open the default port on all network interfaces.
.It Ic max clients Ar number
Set the default maximum number of clients allowed to connect to each
.Xr thingsd 8 thing.
.It Ic max subscriptions Ar number
Set the maximum number of things a client can subscribe to at a time.
.It Ic connection retry Ar number
Set the lost connection thing watchdog interval. Default is 30
seconds. Range is 30-600 seconds.
.It Ic log verbose Ar number
Turn on verbose logging. (This option is currently disabled.)
.El
.Sh THINGS
things represent a serial thing or a TCP/IP host for
.Xr thingsd 8
to communicate with.
.Xr thingsd 8
will setup sockets and bind to things depending on the settings for each
thing.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic baud Ar number
Set the baud rate for a serial thing
.Ar location .
.It Ic bind interface Ar string
Specify a single interface to create a
.Ar location
or
.Ar ipaddr
thing socket.
.It Ic data Ar number
Set the data bits for a serial thing
.Ar location .
.It Ic connect on port Ar number
Set the TCP/IP port to connect to for an
.Ar ipaddr
thing. This setting is required for
.Ar ipaddr
things.
.It Ic thing Ar string Brq ...
Declaration of a thing for
.Xr thingsd 8
to setup and the name
.Xr thingsd 8
will use for client subscriptions.
.It Ic hardware Ar number
Set to 1 to turn on hardware control for a serial thing
.Ar location .
.It Ic ipaddr Ar string Brq ...
Create a
.Ar thing
connection to a hostname or IP address.
.It Ic listen on port Ar number
Set a local socket port for a
.Ar location ,
.Ar udp ,
or
.Ar ipaddr
thing, other than the global default port.
.It Ic location Ar string Brq ...
Create a
.Ar thing
connection to serial interface. These are any valid /dev things, for example
/dev/ttyU0. Set the owner of a thing to _thingsd to allow for autoreconnect in
a privdrop environment, in the event of a serial thing disconnect.
.It Ic max clients Ar number
Set the maximum clients allowed to connect to a thing
.Ar location
or
.Ar ipaddr .
.It Ic parity Ar string
Set the parity for a serial thing
.Ar location .
Parity options are none, odd, even, or space.
.It Ic password Ar string
Set the subscription password for a thing
.Ar location
or
.Ar ipaddr  .
.It Ic persistent Ar number
Set whether
.Xr thingsd 8
binds to an
.Ar ipaddr
thing. If
.Ar persistent
is set to 0,
.Xr thingsd 8
will create a socket, send a client packet, and close that socket. Clients
cannot receive on a non-persistent
.Ar ipaddr
thing.
.It Ic receive on port Ar number
Set the
.Ar udp
port to listen on for a UDP packet. This setting is required for
.Ar udp
things.
.It Ic software Ar number
Set to 1 to turn on software control for a serial thing
.Ar location .
.It Ic stop Ar number
Set the stop bit for a serial thing
.Ar location .
.It Ic udp Ar string Brq ...
Create a
.Ar thing
which listens for user datagram protocol packets.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
This configuration file would create a serial thing and a TCP/IP host thing.
The serial thing would communicate on the default port, while the local network
ipaddr thing would communicate on a separate port.
