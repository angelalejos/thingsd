.Sh NAME
.Nm thingsd
.Nd things proxy daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm thingsd
.Bk -words
.Op Fl d
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
proxy daemon provides a mechanism for clients and client processes to
communicate with an array of serial and IoT things. At its core,
.Nm
is primarily a packet repeater in that it polls for packets to swap between
subscriber clients and things. However,
.Nm
also provides password control over those connections, including client limits.
.Pp
.Nm
can connect directly to serial things, IoT IP things, and single socket
connections. It also provides for UDP listeners.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-f fileXXX"
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize. If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl v
This option allows
.Nm
to send DEBUG priority messages to syslog.
.El
.Pp
Example things tested: XBee, NF24, ESP8266.
.Pp
Subscribers to a thing pass a simple, human-readable packet to
.Nm .
. The format is as follows, without the line breaks and tabs.
This example is only for initial readability and help in understanding
the format!
.Pp
Subscription packets must begin with 3 * 0x7E
.Bd -literal -offset indent
~~~subscribe{
	{name,"CLIENTNAME"},
	{things{
		thing{"dev1","password1"},
		thing{"dev2","password2"}
		}
	}
}
.Ed
.Pp
An accurate example packet:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
~~~subscribe{{name,"CLIENTNAME"},{things{thing{"dev1","password1"}}}}
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
is usually started at boot time, and can be enabled by adding
.Nm
to the
.Va pkg_scripts
line in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local .
See
.Xr rc 8
and
.Xr rc.conf 8
for more information on the boot process and enabling daemons.
.Pp
When
.Nm
starts up, it reads settings from its configuration file, typically
.Xr thingsd.conf 5 ,
and creates sockets and file descriptor connections.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/run/thingsdd.sockXXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/thingsd.conf
Default configuration file.
.It Pa /var/run/thingsd.sock
Socket file for communication with
.Xr thingsctl 8 .
